### Description
There are lots of built-in containers in C++, via which we can easily and efficiently achieve what we want. However, sometimes the sorting ability of them is relatively limited and as a result, we have to come up with the custom `comparer` to re-define the sorting feature. I will try to discuss most of them encountering different situations.

> **Strict Weak Ordering**
Almost all functions/containers (except for example priority_queue<T>) require the ordering to satisfy the standard mathematical definition of a strict weak ordering, or else the behavior of the functions/containers will be undefined.

Let f(x, y) be a comparison function. f is in strict weak ordering if it satisfies three invariants:

Irreflexivity: f(x, x) = false.
Antisymmetry: If f(x, y) then !f(y, x).
Transitivity: If f(x, y) and f(y, z) then f(x, z).
Transitivity of Equivalence: Let equal(x, y) = !f(x, y) && !f(y, x). If equal(x, y) and equal(y, z) then equal(x, z).


### Methods

#### Define operator<()
This method can be used if you want objects of a custom class to be able to be sorted naturally just as usual primitive types. If you want ascending order then return `<` otherwise `>`.

```
class Edge{
public:
    int from, to , weight;
    Edge(int a, int b, int c): from(a), to(b), weight(c){}
    bool operator < (Edge other) const{
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

int main()
{
    vector<Edge> edges;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) edges.emplace_back(i, i+2, 20-i);
    cout<<"Original vector: "<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) cout<<edges[i].weight<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Sorted ascending vector: "<<endl;
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) cout<<edges[i].weight<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    random_shuffle(edges.begin(), edges.end());
    cout<<"Shuffled vector: "<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) cout<<edges[i].weight<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Ascending set: "<<endl;
    set<Edge> edgeSet(edges.begin(), edges.end());
    for(auto e: edgeSet) cout<<e.weight<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Keys ascending map: "<<endl;
    map<Edge, int> edgeMap;
    for(int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) edgeMap[edges[i]] = i*5;
    for(auto& pair: edgeMap) cout<<"key: "<<pair.first.weight<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Descending max heap: "<<endl;
	priority_queue<Edge> maxHeap(edges.begin(), edges.end());
    while(maxHeap.size()){
        cout<<maxHeap.top().weight<<",";
        maxHeap.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The output will be as follows: 

```
Original vector: 
20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,
Sorted ascending vector: 
11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
Shuffled vector: 
17,11,14,16,18,19,15,12,13,20,
Ascending set: 
11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
Keys ascending map: 
key: 11,key: 12,key: 13,key: 14,key: 15,key: 16,key: 17,key: 18,key: 19,key: 20,
Descending max heap: 
20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,
```

But there are also other usages for particular containers using primitive types, especially when you try to customize the behavior of the order for the primitive types: sort, set and map, and priority_queue.

#### Set and map

```
struct cmpClass{
    bool operator()(const int& a, const int& b) const {
        return a > b;
    }
};

int main()
{
	int myints[] = {10, 60, 50, 20};
    vector<int> v(myints, myints+4);

    auto cmpFunc = [](const int a, const int b) { return a > b; };

    cout<<"Sorted int vector using lambda function: "<<endl;
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](const int a, const int b) { return a < b; });
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) cout<<v[i]<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    random_shuffle(v.begin(), v.end());
    cout<<"Shuffled int vector: "<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) cout<<v[i]<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), cmpFunc);
    cout<<"Sorted int vector using cmpFunc: "<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) cout<<v[i]<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    cout<<"Ascending int set using less<int>: "<<endl;
    set<int, less<int>> lessSet(v.begin(), v.end());
    for(auto n: lessSet) cout<<n<<",";
    cout<<endl;


    cout<<"Descending int set using cmpFunc: "<<endl;
    set<int, decltype(cmpFunc)> funcSet(cmpFunc);
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) funcSet.insert(v[i]);
    for(auto n: funcSet) cout<<n<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    cout<<"Descending int set using cmpClass: "<<endl;
    set<int, cmpClass> classSet(v.begin(), v.end());
    for(auto n: classSet) cout<<n<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    cout<<"Descending keys in map using greater<int>: "<<endl;
    map<int, int, greater<int>> greaterMap;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) greaterMap[v[i]] = v[i]*3;
    for(auto& pair: greaterMap) cout<<"key: "<<pair.first<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    cout<<"Descending keys in map using cmpFunc: "<<endl;
    map<int, int, decltype(cmpFunc)> funcMap(cmpFunc);
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) funcMap[v[i]] = 2*v[i];
    for(auto& pair: funcMap) cout<<"key: "<<pair.first<<",";
    cout<<endl;

    cout<<"Descending keys in map using cmpClass: "<<endl;
    map<int, int, cmpClass> classMap;
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) classMap[v[i]] = 3*v[i];
    for(auto& pair: classMap) cout<<"key: "<<pair.first<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The out put will be as follows:

```
Sorted int vector using lambda function: 
10,20,50,60,
Shuffled int vector: 
10,60,50,20,
Sorted int vector using cmpFunc: 
60,50,20,10,
Ascending int set using less<int>: 
10,20,50,60,
Descending int set using cmpFunc: 
60,50,20,10,
Descending int set using cmpClass: 
60,50,20,10,
Descending keys in map using greater<int>: 
key: 60,key: 50,key: 20,key: 10,
Descending keys in map using cmpFunc: 
key: 60,key: 50,key: 20,key: 10,
Descending keys in map using cmpClass: 
key: 60,key: 50,key: 20,key: 10,
```

#### Priority_queue

- primitive types including int, float, ..., and pair;
- `cmpClass` for comparer;
- `cmpFunction` for comparer.

```
struct cmpClass{
    bool operator()(const int a, const int b) const {
        return a < b;
    }
};

int main()
{
	int myints[] = {10, 60, 50, 20};
    vector<int> v(myints, myints+4);
    cout<<"Sorted ascending vector using less<int>: "<<endl;
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), less<int>());
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) cout<<v[i]<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Min heap using greater<int>: "<<endl;
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minIntHeap(myints, myints+4);
    while(minIntHeap.size()) {
        cout<<minIntHeap.top()<<",";
        minIntHeap.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    vector<pair<int, int>> vv;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) vv.emplace_back(20-i, i);
    cout<<"Unsorted pair vector: "<<endl;
    for(int i = 0; i < vv.size(); ++i) cout<<vv[i].first<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Sorted ascending pair vector: "<<endl;
    sort(vv.begin(), vv.end(), less<pair<int, int>>());
    for(int i = 0; i < vv.size(); ++i) cout<<vv[i].first<<",";
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Min heap using greater<pair<int, int>>: "<<endl;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> minPairHeap(vv.begin(), vv.end());
    while(minPairHeap.size()){
        cout<<minPairHeap.top().second<<",";
        minPairHeap.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Max heap using cmpClass to compare int: "<<endl;
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, cmpClass> maxClassHeap(v.begin(), v.end());
    while(maxClassHeap.size()){
        cout<<maxClassHeap.top()<<",";
        maxClassHeap.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    cout<<"Min heap using cmpFunc to compare int: "<<endl;
    auto cmpFunction = [](const int a, const int b) { return a > b; };
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, decltype(cmpFunction)> minFuncHeap(cmpFunction);
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) minFuncHeap.push(v[i]);
    while(minFuncHeap.size()){
        cout<<minFuncHeap.top()<<",";
        minFuncHeap.pop();
    }
    cout<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The output will be as follows:

```
Sorted ascending vector using less<int>: 
10,20,50,60,
Min heap using greater<int>: 
10,20,50,60,
Unsorted pair vector: 
20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,
Sorted ascending pair vector: 
11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,
Min heap using greater<pair<int, int>>: 
9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,
Max heap using cmpClass to compare int: 
60,50,20,10,
Min heap using cmpFunc to compare int: 
10,20,50,60,
```

- a more complex usage for funcCmp.

```
auto cmp = [&nums1, &nums2](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>&b) {
            return nums1[a.first]+nums2[a.second] > nums1[b.first]+nums2[b.second]; };
priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, decltype(cmp)> minHeap(cmp);
```


### Basics
1. Access the inner map via the outer map

```
auto inner_map = cost_function.find(c0);
int minCost = inner_map->second.find(c1)->second;
```


### Description
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a sub-graph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

A minimum spanning tree has (V – 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.

There are lots of applications of MST, while the most well-known is network design: telephone, electrical, hydraulic, TV cable, computer, road
The standard application is to a problem like phone network design. You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isn’t a tree you can always remove some edges and save money.

### Solution

#### Prim's MST
Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm. It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges.

```

// Number of vertices in the graph
#define V 5

// A utility function to find the vertex with minimum key value, from
// the set of vertices not yet included in MST
int minKey(int key[], bool mstSet[]) {
    // Initialize min value
    int min = INT_MAX, min_index;
    for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
        if (mstSet[v] == false && key[v] < min)
            min = key[v], min_index = v;
    return min_index;
}

// A utility function to print the constructed MST stored in parent[]

	// Initialize all keys as INFINITE
	for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
		key[i] = INT_MAX, mstSet[i] = false;

	// Always include first 1st vertex in MST.
	key[0] = 0;	 // Make key 0 so that this vertex is picked as first vertex
	parent[0] = -1; // First node is always root of MST 

	// The MST will have V vertices
	for (int count = 0; count < V-1; count++) {
		// Pick thd minimum key vertex from the set of vertices
		// not yet included in MST
		int u = minKey(key, mstSet);

		// Add the picked vertex to the MST Set
		mstSet[u] = true;

		// Update key value and parent index of the adjacent vertices of
		// the picked vertex. Consider only those vertices which are not yet
		// included in MST
		for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)

		// graph[u][v] is non zero only for adjacent vertices of m
		// mstSet[v] is false for vertices not yet included in MST
		// Update the key only if graph[u][v] is smaller than key[v]
		if (graph[u][v] && mstSet[v] == false && graph[u][v] < key[v])
			parent[v] = u, key[v] = graph[u][v];
	}

	// print the constructed MST
	printMST(parent, V, graph);

	return 0;
}
```

#### Kruskal's
Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm
1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.  
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.  
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

### Basics
1. void qsort (void* base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void*,const void*));
base: Pointer to the first object of the array to be sorted, converted to a void*.
num: Number of elements in the array pointed to by base.  size_t is an unsigned integral type.
size: Size in bytes of each element in the array.  size_t is an unsigned integral type.
compar: Pointer to a function that compares two elements.  This function is called repeatedly by qsort to compare two elements. It shall follow the following prototype:
> int compar (const void* p1, const void* p2);
Taking two pointers as arguments (both converted to const void*). The function defines the order of the elements by returning (in a stable and transitive manner):
return value	meaning
<0	The element pointed to by p1 goes before the element pointed to by p2
0	The element pointed to by p1 is equivalent to the element pointed to by p2
\>0	The element pointed to by p1 goes after the element pointed to by p2

2. void* bsearch (const void* key, const void* base, size_t num, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void*,const void*));
> Searches the given key in the array pointed to by base (which is formed by num elements, each of size bytes), and returns a void* pointer to a matching element, if found. The rule of the **compar** is quite the same as *qsort*.

> **Note** the elements that compare less than key using compar should precede those that compare equal, and these should precede those that compare greater.
